ldfsl
=====

Automate the generation of probabilistic diffusion-tensor tractography using fsl tools.

Coded in c++11. Currently working on a shell script to do the same thing.

Very rough & ready. Please do not expect this to work for you without significant tinkering.

Requires: fsl; fslview; condor; dcm2nii; dcmtk
